# Parity battery run 20260917T131535Z

Note: 0 gaps below covers only these scripted flows; it is not a product-parity verdict (docs/completion-matrix.md).
- ts binary: prime-agent
- rust binary: /home/ubuntu/lane-worktrees/cli-gaps/target/release/prime-agent
- flows: f1_launch, f2_prompt, f3_tool, f4_commands, f5_side_questions, f6_attach, f7_compaction, f8_resume, f9_agents_view, f10_perf, f11_provider_failure

## Findings

0 gaps, 39 parity checks passed.

- [f6_attach/protocol] rust: attached client received 12 events during the turn
- [f6_attach/behavior] rust: CLI 'attach' opened the session in tmux (frame captured)
- [f6_attach/protocol] attach event sequences match (12 projected events, in order; harness-digest custom pairs and turn_end/agent_end payloads are out of scope here — documented model-surface diffs, see PORTING-NOTES)
- [f7_compaction/protocol] ts: daemon 'compact' succeeded: {"summary": "pre-compaction reply 6", "firstKeptEntryId": "ff531675", "tokensBefore": 110, "details": {"readFiles": [], "modifiedFiles": []}}
- [f7_compaction/protocol] rust: daemon 'compact' succeeded: {"firstKeptEntryId": "df501ea0", "summary": "pre-compaction reply 6", "tokensBefore": 110}
- [f8_resume/behavior] print '-c' refuses a session active in the daemon on both sides: 44cfa4521492 (ts) vs 52eead0f5f1c (rust)
- [f8_resume/protocol] session entry type sets match (['compaction', 'custom_message', 'message', 'model_change', 'service_tier_change', 'session', 'session_info', 'session_state', 'thinking_level_change'])
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] ts: agents view groups the roster into Running/Idle/Inactive sections with the scripted sessions in place
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] ts: opening the Running row attached to the live session and its in-flight reply rendered
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] rust: agents view groups the roster into Running/Idle/Inactive sections with the scripted sessions in place
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] rust: opening the Running row attached to the live session and its in-flight reply rendered
- [f9_agents_view/visual] agents view frames identical at 120x36 (normalized: paths, ids, ages)
- [f9_agents_view/visual] agents view frames identical at 220x50 (normalized: paths, ids, ages)
- [f10_perf/perf] ts: cold startup to interactive-ready median 0.831s over 3 launches (first frame median 0.816s); typing latency median 6.2ms, p95 14.2ms over 75 keystrokes
- [f10_perf/perf] rust: cold startup to interactive-ready median 0.150s over 3 launches (first frame median 0.150s); typing latency median 5.9ms, p95 6.2ms over 75 keystrokes
- [f10_perf/perf] startup: rust 0.150s vs ts 0.831s cold-ready median (ratio 0.18, threshold 1.5)
