Note: 0 gaps below covers only these scripted flows; it is not a product-parity verdict (docs/completion-matrix.md).
- ts binary: prime-agent
- rust binary: /home/ubuntu/lane-worktrees/roster-wire/target/release/prime-agent
- flows: f9_agents_view

## Findings

0 gaps, 6 parity checks passed.


## Passed checks

- [f9_agents_view/behavior] ts: agents view groups the roster into Running/Idle/Inactive sections with the scripted sessions in place
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] ts: opening the Running row attached to the live session and its in-flight reply rendered
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] rust: agents view groups the roster into Running/Idle/Inactive sections with the scripted sessions in place
- [f9_agents_view/behavior] rust: opening the Running row attached to the live session and its in-flight reply rendered
- [f9_agents_view/visual] agents view frames identical at 120x36 (normalized: paths, ids, ages)
- [f9_agents_view/visual] agents view frames identical at 220x50 (normalized: paths, ids, ages)
